# Bookshelf
Book Shelf is an Android Repo that was created because I wanted to learn more about live data and view models.

So I created an App that uses Retrofit 2.6.0 now with [Coroutine Support](https://proandroiddev.com/suspend-what-youre-doing-retrofit-has-now-coroutines-support-c65bd09ba067) to fectch a list of books from a gist I found while learning Kotlin/JS at [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/201669-web-app-with-kotlin-js-getting-started).

This was a fun exercise to learn and further my knowledge. feel free to fork and play.
